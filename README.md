# LSB Image Steganography

## 📌 Project Overview
The **LSB Image Steganography** project demonstrates the art of hiding secret communication within digital images. Steganography is the practice of concealing sensitive information inside another medium so that its existence is not apparent. Unlike cryptography, which obscures the meaning of a message, steganography hides the very presence of the message itself.

Digital images are the most commonly used carriers because of their widespread availability on the internet. By modifying the **Least Significant Bits (LSB)** of pixel values, secret data can be embedded into images without noticeably altering their appearance.

## ✨ Features
- Hide secret text or data inside images.  
- Extract hidden data from stego-images.  
- Demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of LSB-based techniques.  
- Easy to implement and understand for beginners.  

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Select a cover image (carrier).  
2. Embed secret data by modifying the least significant bits of pixel values.  
3. Generate a new image (stego-image) that looks visually identical to the original.  
4. Extract hidden data from the stego-image using the decoding algorithm.  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple file types (audio, video).  
- Improved algorithms for better invisibility and capacity.  
- Integration of encryption before embedding.  

## 📖 Learning Outcomes
By working on this project, you will:
- Understand the basics of **steganography** and **information hiding**.  
- Gain hands-on experience with **image processing**.  
- Learn how to balance **invisibility vs. capacity** in data hiding.
